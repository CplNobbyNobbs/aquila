				<h2>About us</h2>
  			<p>The Inquisition was created around the Horus Heresy on order of Malcador the Sigillite, the Emperor's right-hand man. Malcador assembled 12 individuals of "an inquisitive nature", 8 loyal Astartes and 4 mortal Imperial lords and administrators, who would respectively become the initial core of the Grey Knights and the conclaves of the Inquisition. The Inquisition functions like the CIA, NSA, and FBI combined into one entity. Individual Inquisitors have a high degree of autonomy with which to conduct themselves. They gather information thorough informants, conduct investigations, and prosecute individuals as they see fit, often to deadly effect.</p>
				<p>However, the more radical elements of the Inquisition also possess many forces of their own, such as the Radical Malleus' daemonhosts bound in Emperor blessed chains and seals or the trillions of pertinent and brainwashed former chaos or renegade marines that go to war with their armor devoid of any markings. The Ordo Xenos has radical elements as well like hidden android robotic armies from the Iron Men or the freed Necrons souls of the enslaved Void Dragon on Mars, a hope for the radicals that the Emperor can bind the corrupt xenos into his service.</p>
   			<p>There were originally only two Orders within the Inquisition(Ordo Malleus and Ordo Xenos), but a third (the Ordo Hereticus) was added after the events of the Age of Apostasy. A further fourth the Ordo Sicarius was formed following the Wars of Vindication. It is rumored that the Inquisition has thousands of independent ordos and cells for various goals and tasks, and the resources they pool together can rival those individually owned by Inquisitor Lords.</p>
