				<h2>Disciples of the Machine God</h2>
  			<p>Through the darkening twilight come the Cult Mechanicus, their exhaust fumes tinged with incense and their voices raised in sinister prayer. This is no regimented military force, nor a benevolent gathering of holy men, but a procession of cybernetic horrors and soulless automatons. Each of their number has willingly traded away his humanity, fashioned as a living weapon in the hands of his inhuman masters. The Cult Mechanicus bring not forgiveness, nor mercy, nor a chance for conversion to their creed. Instead they bring death; a thousand different kinds, each measured and recorded for later assimilation.</p>
				<p>Perhaps these are the kind of priests the Imperium needs most, for Humanity teeters on the brink of disaster. Together, the Tech-Priests command enough firepower to drive back the night forever. They extend the iron grip of the Omnissiah wherever they go, illuminating the dark corners of the galaxy with his white-hot enlightenment. It is a light they wield not as a giver of life, but as a weapon â€“ a killing blaze that burns uncertainty from the universe and replaces it with a cold and terrible logic. Their enemies are those who keep the treasures of the galaxy from the forge worlds where they belong, those who truck with unhallowed machines, and those who keep the Cult Mechanicus from their holy cause for even a moment. These infidels are slain without mercy.</p>
        <p>And so the procession marches from world to world, the haunted skies above strobing white with colossal energy discharge. Lightning leaps from the outstretched hands of the faithful, burning the unbeliever to ash wherever he may hide. Arcane cannons flatten and twist the foe, as if their unworthy bodies are being wrought unto ruin by the Omnissiah himself.</p>
